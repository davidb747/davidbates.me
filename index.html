<h2>Hi, I'm David Bates</h2>

<p>
  I‚Äôm a Physics graduate from <b>Imperial College London</b> with a passion for
  <b>sports analytics</b>, <b>machine learning</b>, and using data to solve real-world problems.
  I love applying statistical modelling to sport, where numbers can uncover trends, challenge assumptions,
  and improve decision-making.
</p>

<h3>Projects</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    üèà <a href="https://davidbates.me/nfl/">A custom Elo rating system</a> that tracks and predicts NFL team performance,
    adjusting for factors like home-field advantage and margin of victory.
  </li>
  <li>
    üéØ <a href="https://davidbates.me/deepcue/">DeepCue</a>, a machine-learning model that forecasts snooker outcomes
    by blending historical performance, matchup dynamics, and engineered features.
  </li>
</ul>

    <h3>Climate & Data Analysis</h3>
    <p>
      My Master‚Äôs thesis focused on analysing satellite climate and emissions datasets,
      applying statistical inference to identify environmental trends and changes over time.
      This project combined data wrangling, statistical modelling, and clear visual storytelling
      to make complex patterns accessible to both scientific and general audiences.

<h3>Beyond Sports</h3>
<p>
  My work also spans data automation and large-scale dataset exploration.
  I‚Äôve built automated reporting pipelines and analytical workflows using Python, SQL, and Excel VBA,
  transforming raw information into clear and actionable insights.
</p>

<h3>Currently</h3>
<p>
  I‚Äôm <b>looking for opportunities</b> at the intersection of data science, sport, finance, and technology.
  I‚Äôm keen to collaborate‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs co-developing models, exploring new datasets, or simply exchanging ideas.
  If this resonates, let‚Äôs talk.
