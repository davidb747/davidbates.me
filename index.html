Currently, I am a PhD student at the College of Computer Studies at De La Salle University - Manila under a scholarship grant of the Commission of Higher Education in the Philippines. I'm also part of Center for Complexity and Emerging Technologies where I conduct research work about the structure and dynamics understaning of a Complex Network. Also, I work on projects related in Machine Learning more particularly on Graph Neural Networks and Geometric Deep Learning.
