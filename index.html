      Glenn Paul Gara is an Assistant Professor in Computer Science and Information Technology at the University of the Immaculate Conception. Currently, he is a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the College of Computer Studies in De La Salle University-Manila under a Ph.D. scholarship grant of the Commission of Higher Education, Philippines. He is a researcher at the Center for Complexity and Emerging Technologies where he is studying the structure and dynamics of a collaboration network via structural analysis and network visualization. Under the supervision of Dr. Arnulfo Azcarraga, he is currently working on his dissertation about neurobiologically-inspired incremental learning algorithm for wide single hidden layer network. His research interests are Complex Networks and Machine Learning.
