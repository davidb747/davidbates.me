## Goals

- Learn rust

## Requirements

- There should be a front end with a **console output**, in which the challenges will run
- The input file from advent of code should be downloadable from the web page
- Using **gitalk**, a comment section should be available on each day
- On each day, a link to the source code in github should be available
- The **duration should be timed** and the result should be displayed on the web page
- The project should be built using **docker** and **github actions**, and should be automatically deployed to my **kubernetes cluster**
