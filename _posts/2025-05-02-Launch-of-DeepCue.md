### ðŸ¤– DeepCue: Zhao Xintong will WIN the World Snooker Championship

This week, I gave myself a 48-hour challenge:

- Scrape and clean live snooker match data  
- Engineer predictive features from performance stats  
- Train both an XGBoost and a Neural Network model  
- Tune hyperparameters and generate predictions  
- Develop an MVP of DeepCue â€” a snooker match prediction engine  
- Do it all while revising for exams ðŸ˜…

And the first prediction is in!

Both models independently predicted **Zhao Xintong** to beat **Mark Williams** in the final â€” but with different confidence levels:

- ðŸ“ˆ **XGBoost**: 68% probability  
- ðŸ¤– **Neural Network**: 52% probability

### ðŸŽ¯ Model Performance (on test data)

- **XGBoost**: 68.13% accuracy, 0.7513 ROC AUC  
- **Neural Net**: 67.09% accuracy, 0.7417 ROC AUC

This project tested my **full-stack data science skills** under time pressure â€” from scraping raw data to modelling and interpretation.

The models were trained on **41,290 ranking matches (2006â€“present)** using **81 engineered features**, primarily based on frame-level scoring trends over time.

Iâ€™ve got lots of ideas for improvement and plan to take this further over the summer â€” including applying the approach to other sports with more accessible data.

Letâ€™s see if the models were right! ðŸ§ ðŸŽ¯
