After watching a video from [Thomas Frank about is Impossible List](https://collegeinfogeek.com/about/meet-the-author/my-impossible-list/) I decided to make my own. The goal of the list is to not let me get comfortable in life and stop trying new things. I don't want to feel like my life is passing by without me having a say on it. I took a lot of inspiration from Thomas Frank and Joel Runyon, the original creator of the Impossible List.
