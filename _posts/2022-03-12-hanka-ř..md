Thank God for the memory of Brother Nat. He was always full of God's love and the life that flowed from him was encouraging and comforting. There was a time when I was going through some trials, sometimes being up and sometimes being down in the valley. Brother Nat told me that I should experience Christ in these situations, because the Lord Jesus works in us to make more room for God's purpose. Grace upon grace came from the Lord, and I really saw that He was the One working in us. I also have a joyful testimony… whenever Nat heard that there was interest in ministry books, he would immediately prepare a box of books and offer them with joy. Amen.

We are thankful that God called and brought Brother Nat and his family to the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Letovice (Viski), and other various places. May the seed of life arise in resurrection and spread wherever our brother had moved in Christ Jesus. Amen.
