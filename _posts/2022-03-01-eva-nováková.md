I am very grateful to the Lord Jesus that I was able to meet Brother Nat in my lifetime. He baptized me and also my son Petr. Brother Nat always encouraged me to call on the name of the Lord, especially when I had a failure. His heart was full of Christ's love, grace and life supply. Thank You, Lord Jesus, for this precious brother. Amen.
