"All the way my Savior leads me"

This song is the experience of my youngest son, Nathaniel Kong. He was born during the flood in October 1962. Rising flood waters prevented travel to the hospital so with the help of our backdoor neighbor who was a nurse and the ambulance driver, Nat came into the world before my eyes. Mother and baby were transported from the waiting ambulance to the hospital via dump truck. Because he born outside the hospital, he was placed in a closet in the maternity ward rather than in the nursery. His birth was indeed special.

In December 1962 our family went to Los Angeles to attend Witness Lee's first conference in this country. Nat was the youngest attendee at 3 months old. 

After college, He was led by the Lord to attend the Fulltime Training in Taipei with many other young believers. 

Later, Nat was blessed with a dear wife who was willing to go along with him as he followed the Lord's leading to go to Eastern Europe for the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. When they returned from Europe in 2013 he continued to serve the Lord with the students on the college campus and with many others of various backgrounds.

When I received news of Nat's passing, in grief, all I could do is call on the Lord.

In our sorrow and grief, we have been comforted and consoled by the visits, cards, and messages from many brothers and sisters, far and near, as well as our friends and our neighbors.
