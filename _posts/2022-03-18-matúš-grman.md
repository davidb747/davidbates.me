One of the outstanding things which I remember when being with brother Nat, is peace. Everything around seemed to run smoothly, as in a flow. His smiling face was the result of the enjoyment and trust in the Lord which you could touch, just from a short moment of being with him. I'm very grateful to the Lord, that brother Nat and sister Wanchi responded to the Lord's call to come and live in Slovakia. The times that I could spend with them and with the family are of eternal value and I treasure them very much as also the pattern which brother Nat is for me.
