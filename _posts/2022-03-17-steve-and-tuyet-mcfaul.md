Tuyet and I heard of the tragic event that took place in the Church in Sacramento meeting hall. We were devastated to hear that our brother and friend Nathaniel Kong was one of the victims of the shooting. We knew Nathaniel well and even served with him in Berlin, Germany in 2016. I have some fond memories of him and I walking from the meeting hall to a nearby turkish hamburger restaurant to eat the best hamburger and sweet potato fries ever (at  least we thought so), at a very reasonable price. We did that more than once. I remember also that Tuyet and I had gone out to eat with him along with several refugees for at least one dinner. He was a faithful shepherd of the refugees.

We are sure that Nathaniel touched many lives during his service to the Lord. He was a faithful brother, a good and faithful slave. We will miss him greatly, and we will keep the family in our prayers. May the Lord's grace and mercy sustain Nat's family during this very difficult time.
