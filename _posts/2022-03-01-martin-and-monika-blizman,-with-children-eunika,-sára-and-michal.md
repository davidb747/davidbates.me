With great sadness and sorrow in our hearts we received the news of the unexpected departure of our dear brother Nat, and although we did not know him as long as other brothers and sisters in the Czech Republic and Slovakia (who worked with him and his family when building the foundation of the church in these localities), even the brief time we spent with him at the children’s Bible camp and conferences was enough so that the traces of Christ's love and His gentle care seen in him would remain with us forever. We will never forget his smile and the teaching of the Word, in which he had so much knowledge. Yet, he was always teaching in such a humble way in a spirit of meekness. Everything he did testified that he truly loved the Lord and served Him with all his heart, all his soul, and all his mind. Therefore, we have no doubt that he is still with the Lord even now, just at a different place. Nevertheless, we will miss him very much. We are thankful to God for his service to the church. Nathaniel Kong was a precious gift to us.
