I met Brother Nat sometime in 2000 during a fellowship at our home. I got to know him as a humble person, always willing to help in various matters. He even participated in helping us with the new roof on our house, so whenever I see our roof I can remember Brother Nat. One time, we served together visiting the saints in some places in the Czech Republic. He will remain permanently in my memories!
