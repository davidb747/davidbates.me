Brother Nat used to come and see us when we were in college. Irenka Ř., Jana H., Daniel Ř, and I used to meet with him. We would read the Bible and something from the ministry together. It was very nice that Brother Nat personally took care of us in such a way. Whenever I had concerns, he would encourage me with this verse: “Do not let your heart be troubled.” While traveling within the United States, he and his whole family took us on trips to the national parks in California. Sister Wanchi was amazing at the Bible camps in Slovakia, teaching the children verses and making fun activities and pictures with the children.
