I first met Brother Nat and his family during the summer of 2001. It was around that time when the Kong family had moved to the Czech Republic. Joseph and Deborah were small children at that time. Brother Nat was a friendly brother and I still remember a friendly talk we had on one of our first encounters. I think it was in the Kong's home when I saw something concerning the church life. It was at a time when several saints were gathered together in the Kong's home for a meal and informal fellowship. After that and through the following years, I received shepherding care and hospitality from Nat and his family. My last in person contact with brother Nat was in the autumn of 2021, when he and Joseph visited Prague. Brother Nat was a friendly, approachable, and humble brother. Brother Nat helped me to see the God ordained way as something that is doable, even when there are limitations. Thank the Lord for brother Nat and his portion.
