I didn't know Brother Nat personally, but I am very sorry for what happened. However, I know from other brothers and sisters that Brother Nat was very kind, warm-hearted and willing to help anyone. He loved the Lord and lived Christ. I wish I could have known him personally. May the Lord, by His grace and love, take care of Nat's family and all who will miss him dearly.
