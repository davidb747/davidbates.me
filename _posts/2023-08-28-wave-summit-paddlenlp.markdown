Ever since the Large Language Model (LLM) revolution took over in 2023, I have been working on the engineering side of LLMs, developing the tools and platforms that support Baidu's flagship LLM [ERNIE Bot](http://research.baidu.com/Blog/index-view?id=183). I am delighted to share a talk that my colleague and I presented at the [WAVE SUMMIT 2023深度学习开发者大会](https://www.wavesummit.com.cn/). In this talk, we introduced [PaddleNLP](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleNLP) and [PaddleMix](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleMIX), which are the open-source versions of our work on LLMs and multi-modal models, respectively.

The slides for the talk are accessible [here](https://sijunhe-blog.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/files/WaveSummit_2023_slides.pdf), and a recording can be viewed [here](https://www.wavesummit.com.cn/#/back?liveId=de77314cbd8e000&agendaId=10e8c39e0f61c000).
