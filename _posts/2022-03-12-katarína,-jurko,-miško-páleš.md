Brother Nat was a very dear and precious brother to us. I remember Brother Nat's love for my sons, Jurko and Miško. Along with other brothers, he was able to stand in as a male role model for my boys during a difficult time in our lives.
Brother Nat was shining wherever he was – at meetings in Bratislava, in Košice, in Prievidza, in Poprad, in Žilina, at children's camps, and on joint trips. His shepherding was amazing, including the patience he had in listening, even to small children. It is impossible to describe what he did… what he left in our hearts.

My parents also have not forgotten the unique visits and meetings with the saints in their apartment. We all remember the night when the brothers and Nat brought Sister Zoe to my parents’ when she needed a place to stay in Prievidza.
Our entire family extends our sincere sympathy to Sister Wanchi, Deborah, Bethany, Joseph, and all the saints in the church. We remain in prayer, and we stand with all of you in oneness with the Body. We are one, no matter where we live or what our circumstances are. We are in the Spirit, in the oneness of the Body of Christ.
