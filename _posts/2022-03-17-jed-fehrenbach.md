In Spring of 2001, during my third year of college, I spent one semester studying overseas in Prague. Nat and Wanchi were already there, and I met them for the first time within my first few days of arriving, at a meeting on the Lord's day. Nat connected with me right away. He found out that I liked to play guitar, and shortly after that he gave me his personal guitar to borrow and use during my entire time there, which was several months. I was very shepherded by having his guitar to borrow, and the way was opened for me to come to the meetings and to serve by playing it. I felt like a normal functioning member within a week of arriving to a new locality, in a new country, on a different continent. This was because of Nat's immediate care and shepherding. He had a way with people that was so direct, yet so warm, caring, generous, and unassuming. I never felt pressured to serve, it was a response within because of the Lord shepherding me through Nathaniel.

Regarding Nat's passing, I struggled and cried out to the Lord for days after hearing about it. I asked the Lord many times "Why?". This shouldn't happen to believers, I thought, especially ones so faithful. The Lord answered me. Nat died doing what he loved - taking care of people, which is exactly what I (Jesus) did for you (all of us). This has made a very strong impression on my being. Nat's death was a grain of wheat falling into the ground, and many grains have been, and will be brought forth because of what was poured out.

Both Nat's living and his dying were such a bright shining testimony of the life of the Lord Jesus being lived out.
