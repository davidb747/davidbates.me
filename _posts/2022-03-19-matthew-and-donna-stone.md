I found in Nathanael a brother, a coworker, a laboring priest, and a lover of man. I needed to serve with Nathanael because I need to see Christ lived out in others. 

Because the Kong family was going on in the Lord, it was possible for my family and I to go on with the Lord. It is not a small thing that your family were willing to be in the Czech Republic. That experience of Christ has been builded into the Body and now many are able to do what was once thought impossible.

 

You are in our hearts,
Matthew and Donna Stone
