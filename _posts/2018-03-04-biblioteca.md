This is a software that I develop for school in 2014. The objective of the software is to manage a library. The software allows for the library worker to manage:

* Books
* Patrons
* Loans
* Authors
* Book categories
* Publishers

## Video review

## Branches

* **Master:** The code has I left it in 2014
* **Updated:** Left all the same structure, files and functions but change the code to be more in-line with the C# standards

## Development

To be able to run the software you need a MySql server and run the `biblioteca.sql` script. Then using VisualStudio it should be plug and play.

## Problems

As I said before this was a project for school and at the time I was new to software development, this means that there are a lot of problems with the software. Here are a few:

* Passwords are not encrypted
* Forms are not closed instead they are hidden
* A lot of duplicated code
* Old technologies
