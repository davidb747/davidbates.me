I met Brother Nat at the church meetings in Bratislava, when I was 18-19 years old. I would be lying if I said I knew him very well. Actually, I did know his children and his wife, and I admired his view of family, of the church, and of God. I feel sorry that Peto, my husband, did not have the chance to meet him. 

I probably have never seen Brother Nat sad. Of course, when he was talking about important things, he didn't smile then, but even in that situation, there was such a calming power coming from within. Therefore, I knew that what he was saying was not of his own nature but were words that the Lord Himself was speaking to me, to us… trying to calm us, to direct us, and to instruct us. In short, whatever was needed in that situation. When I close my eyes I remember exactly what his American Czech-Slovak was like. He never said anything extra and he always made sense, whether it was a 5 minute sharing at the Lord's Table or a 40 minute message at a conference. The Lord found a channel in our brother through which He was able to infuse into my spirit and I believe into other people's spirits as well.

Even though Brother Nat was quite busy, I always saw him taking care of his family, his wife, and his children. They always had activities planned that he and Wanchi took care of together. In this too, they are a pattern to me to this day, in regards to our daughter Hana, to keep her busy with activities and to expand her skills as well. At the same time, for me and Pete to support one another.
I don't even know how to conclude, because the news of Brother Nat´s departure surprised and shocked me. Lord, be peace, rest and full supply to the whole family. Cover Wanchi, Joseph, Deborah, and Bethany with Yourself. May Your words, Lord, sown by our brother, bring forth a harvest.
