I am happy to share that I recently joined the [PaddlePaddle](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle) group at [Baidu](https://baidu.com/), where I will primarily work on [PaddleNLP](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleNLP). In the summer of 2015, I had the pleasure of a brief internship with Baidu and had a great experience. And when the opportunity of working on a top-class library such as PaddleNLP came up, I knew I had to grasp it! This is my first time working full-time on an open-source project, where most (if not all) of my work will be public. I am looking forward to contributing to the Chinese NLP and Open Source community!
