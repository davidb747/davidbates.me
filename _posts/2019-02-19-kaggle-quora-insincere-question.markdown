**All credit to my teammates, my team placed 22nd out of 4037 in the [Quora Insincere Questions Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification)**. The key challenge is to weed out insincere questions on Quora, while keeping the training and inference time below the 4 GPU-hour limit. 

I deserve no credit on this one, as my contribution was trivial. My attempts on the Character Embeddings never paid off as the gain in performance wasn't worth the slow-down in training. Please refer to the [nice write-up](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification/discussion/80514) and the [kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/ryches/22nd-place-solution-6-models-pos-tagging/) by Ryan Chesler for our solution.
