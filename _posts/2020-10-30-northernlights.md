#### **TRAVELOGUE**
In this travelogue, I cover my journey up to the white north and my experience hunting down the fabled Northern Lights or Aurora Boreolis

Having lived in Stockholm for over 5 years, I was yet to see the fabled Northern lights. It has been quite elusive to me in my previous visits to the North. So five of us decided to embark on a journey above the Arctic circle and hunt it down.

## The Journey:
From Stockholm, we had to travel about 1200 km north to maximize our chances of finding Northern lights. In the COVID19 era, it did not feel right to fly out to the nearest airport at Luleå or Kiruna, both situated in Sweden’s largest and the northern-most province- Norrbotten. So we booked a coupe for six in SJ’s overnight train to Boden from Stockholm Central. Normally the train is supposed to proceed towards the northern-most mining town of Kiruna but due to track maintenance work stopped at Boden. Here SJ could do a better job notifying route changes to their passengers in advance! From Boden we booked a car rental to further travel up north. Something I realized here is that a driving license is an absolute necessity. For our stay up in the North, we booked a nice cottage via AirBnB on the banks of the Torne river in Pajala.

As evident from the picture above, Norrbotten is already experiencing winter when 1200 kms south, the trees have just decided to start shedding their leaves. So you need to prepare for a -12 to -15 degrees C when you embark upon this trip. Remember, it is even more important since you will be scouting for the lights out in the cold when it is dark and wont necessarily be staying indoors.

We started from Stockholm at 18:00 hrs to reach Boden early morning the next day at 06:00. Then Pajala was a further 3.5 hours drive towards the north.

## Scouting for the Northern lights
##### Ye northern lights *kidhar hai? Peepal ped ke aagey left le lo*
(Transl. Where is this northern lights? Take a left from the banyan tree.)

Here is the thing about Northern lights. You cant drive up to a local and ask him/her which way to go see Northern lights like you would for the Eiffel tower or the Taj Mahal. At the same time you shouldn’t necessarily decide to ‘wing’ it either. You get to see them with some patience and following weather updates.

We kept track on the two main aspects on our smart phones:

#### Aurora activity:
http://www.aurora-service.eu/

#### Cloud cover:
https://www.smhi.se/q/Stockholm/2673730

Aurora activity is a general measure of the probability and/or the intensity of the appearance of the Northern lights. It goes on a scale between kp 0 to kp 8. Anything above 3 is considered good above the Arctic circle, provided you are out of city limits where there is a lot of light pollution, rendering the Northern lights invisible. The website updates prediction for every 3 hour window, guided by NASA’s satellites. This measure varied between 1 to 5 during our stay in Pajala. kp 5 is considered really intense, so much that it might be visible from southern latitudes as well. See here

> all the talk about Aurora is pointless if the cloud spoils the party

Coming to the second point, all the talk about Aurora is pointless if the cloud spoils the party which exactly happened in our case for two days. Our cottage stood at the right latitude and the right level of Aurora activity. BUT it got densely clouded in the night. That is where we used the cloud cover prediction website which worked reasonably well and provided us locations on the map within a driving distance of 100–200 kms that had clear skies. And to give credit where it is due: *Climate prediction works!* wv
