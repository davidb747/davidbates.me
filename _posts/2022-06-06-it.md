## Frequency Domain Transformation

Frequency domain transformation operator, when applied to images, decompose them from gray-level of the spatial 
domain to the components in fundamental frequencies in frequencies domain

### Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)

The DFT, when applied to image $f(k,l)$ with finite elements $N × M$, it provides coefficient of transform $F(u,v)$ of dimension $N × M$ as below :

$$ F(u,v) = \sum\limits_{k=0}^{N-1}\sum\limits_{l=0}^{M-1}\, f(k,l)\,B(k,l;\,u,v)$$

where $$B(k,l;u,v)$$ indicates the images forming the base of the frequency space identified by the $$u-v$$ system, each with dimension $$k × l$$ Therfore, the transformation process quantifies the decomposition  of the input image $$f(k,l)$$ in the weighted sum of the base images, where the coefficients $$F(u,v)$$ are precisely the weights.

- The values of the frequencies near the origin of the system $$(u,v) →  $$ __low frequencies__.
- The value farthest from the origin $$\to$$  __high frequencies__

The input image $$f(k,l)$$ can be reconstructed in the spatial domain through the coefficients of the transform $$F(u,v)$$ with the equation of the inverse Fourier transform, i.e,

$$f(k,l) = F^{-1}(F(u,v)) =\sum\limits_{u=0}^{N-1}\sum\limits_{v=0}^{M-1} F(u,v)B^{-1}(k,l;\,u,v)$$

- When the basic images of transformation are represented by __sine__ and __cosine__ functions, the transformation of image $$f(k,l)$$ is given by  :

$$F(u,v) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{NM}}\sum\limits_{k=0}^{N-1}\sum\limits_{l=0}^{M-1} f(k,l) ⋅ \left[\text{cos} \left(2 π \left(\frac{uk}{N} + \frac{vl}{M}\right)\right) +j \text{sin} \left(2π \left(\frac{uk}{N} + \frac{vl}{M}\right)\right)\right]$$

where function $$F(u,v)$$ represents the frequency content of the image $$f(k,l)$$, which is complex and periodic in both $$u$$ and $$v$$ with period $$2\pi$$. Here, cosine represents the _real part_ and sine is the _complex part_, thus the general expression can be written as :

$$F(u,v) = R_{e}(u,v) + jI_{m}(u,v)$$

__DFT - Magnitude, Phase Angle and Power Spectrum__ 

However, the real and imaginary components are not effective representation, the more effective representation of coefficient $$F(u,v)$$ is through magnitude $$\lvert F(u,v) \rvert$$ and Phase Angle $$Φ (u,v)$$ as :

$$ \lvert F(u,v) \rvert = \sqrt{R_{e}^2\,(u,v) + I_{m}^2\,(u,v)} $$

$$Φ (u,v) = tan^{-1}\left[\frac{I_{m}(u,v)}{R_{e}(u,v)}\right]$$

Then, Fourier Transform, in terms of its magnitude and phase can be written as :

$$F(u,v) = R_{e}(u,v) + jI_{m}(u,v) = \lvert F(u,v) \rvert e^{j Φ (u,v)}$$

and __power spectrum__ or spectral density $$P(u,v)$$ of an image is defined as :

$$P(u,v) = \lvert F(u,v) \rvert^2 = R_{e}^2(u,v) + I_{m}^2(u,v)$$

Fourier Transform when applied to the trigonometric form, the Euler relation $$e^{jx} = \text{cos} x + j \text{sin} x$$ becomes

$$F(u,v) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{NM}}\sum\limits_{k=0}^{N-1}\sum\limits_{l=0}^{M-1} f(k,l) ⋅ e^{-2π j\left[u\frac{k}{N} + v\frac{l}{M}\right]}$$

Similarly, the Inverse DFT, then becomes :

$$f(k,l) = \frac{1}{NM}\sum\limits_{u=0}^{N-1} \sum\limits_{v=0}^{M-1} F(u,v) e^{2 π j\left[k\frac{u}{N} + l\frac{v}{M}\right]}$$
