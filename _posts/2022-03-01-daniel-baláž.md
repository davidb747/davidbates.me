I know Brother Nat and his family only by hearsay, so my testimony of his life and work is only a testimony of what the saints have testified. We joined the church life in Košice in 2016, when Brother Nat was no longer living here. The saints spoke of him as a brother who was full of Christ, always being there for the saints. I remember how the saints would always ask in the meetings: "Do you have a song?" Later it was explained to me that it was Brother Nat who used to ask the saints for a song in that way during the meetings. Perhaps in closing, we too are very grateful for his faithful ministry. Our family is proof that his ministry has been blessed and multiplied by the Lord.
