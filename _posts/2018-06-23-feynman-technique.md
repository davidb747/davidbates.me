The Feynman Technique in a learning technique invented by Richard Feynman. This technique helps you to understand the subject you are trying to learn instead of just memorizing it. As Richard Feynman once said:

> The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool.

In my perspective this means that you should not thing you know something just because you memorized it, you need to understand it and know how to apply it in real life. Here are the steps of the technique:

1. Write the title

   In a blank page write the name of the thing you are trying to learn

2. Explain it

   In the simplest way possible write, like if you are trying to explain it to someone, about the thing you are trying to lean. You can use any means to explain, like, analogies, graph, drawings... Try to simplify the explanation as much as possible, like if you were teaching it to a 5 year old.

3. Study / research

   Analyze what you wrote in step 2 and study the part you detect need more knowledge or more clarification. To obtain the knowledge you can use books, videos, people...

Was you can see this technique is basically based in the principle that you learn better when you are trying to teach, there is a famous quote that says:

> If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.
