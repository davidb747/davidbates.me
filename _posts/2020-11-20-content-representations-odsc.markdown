For the last few quarters, I have been working at the intersection of Recommendations and NLP, thinking about ways to  represent textual information for Twitter's recommendation products. Recently, my colleague Kenny Leung and I gave a talk at [ODSC 2020](https://odsc.com/speakers/building-content-embedding-with-self-supervised-learning/) about our experience building and serving self-supervised content representations for recommendations on Twitter. 

The slides for the talk can be found [here](https://sijunhe-blog.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/files/WaveSummit_2023_slides.pdf).
