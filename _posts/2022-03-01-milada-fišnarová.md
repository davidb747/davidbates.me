I'd like to add a memory of our brother Nathaniel. Praise the Lord for such a brother who, together with other saints, ministered to us greatly in Czechia when the Lord's recovery began here. Every time I saw him, he always had a smile and a great attitude with a warm heart. You could see and feel that his heart was full of the Lord Jesus. I believe that he loved the Lord Jesus Christ with all his heart and he simply ministered His love to others. He always impressed me with an amazing peace about him. I also greatly appreciated that he learned Czech because of us, so that even those of us who do not speak English could communicate. He was a very kind brother. Praise and glory to his memory.
