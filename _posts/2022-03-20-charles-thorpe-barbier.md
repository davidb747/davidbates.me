I knew Brother Nat for several months. I got to know a little more about him since I joined the club back in August of last year. We had a bunch in common like we lived in the same local area, he also studied engineering when he was in college like me and some of our other brothers in the Christian club, and above all we were brothers in Christ.

I was very devastated to hear what happened to him and those three girls. This tragic event was something I never saw coming and neither did any of us. Even after three weeks, I’m still hurt by this and I hope I’m able to recover. But I still know that we still have to keep pursuing the Lord no matter what attack the devil might pull out against us.

As 1 Chronicles 16:11 says, Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually.

Nathaniel has finished his race, so we must continue ours because Jesus is the author and finisher of our faith.
