title: Git Push Script
tags: script python git
---

This script is my attempt of simplifying git, by putting tree git commands in one.
The sript will  ```git add```, ```git commit``` and ```git push```.
This will result in a simpler command but a lot less flexible.
The script will always add all the files to the commit and pust to origin master.
To use the command you need to be in the directory of the repository and use the command ```$ gitpush commitMessage```.
Example: ```$ gitpush Updated readme file```


Versions:

```text
0.01 (2016-05-05)
   Initial drop

0.02 (2016-05-06)
   Added keyboard interruption handler
   Fixed commit message
```
