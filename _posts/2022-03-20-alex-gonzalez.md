I served on the Sacramento Campus team with brother Nat the last two years. But I first met Nat my senior year in college through the Christian students club, and his home was one of the first homes I went to as I was entering church life. It was his home that I could really see a life here in, he was just so inviting, and welcoming. He really had a heart for the students, and was such a pattern for me. 

After college I spoke with him about going to full time training in Anaheim and he was just so happy and had a big smile. He was just so supportive. And after a year in the training I shared with him about wanting to serve full time, and he asked what I thought about serving in Sacramento. I was just so happy when he asked me to consider Sacramento.  

Brother Nat was a pattern to me in serving full time. He was more than just a pattern, he was my spiritual father, caring for me, encouraging me to continue serving the Lord. Many times he would call me when I was discouraged and just listen, and pray with me. In his life and living I could really see what it is to serve the Lord full time, in a long term way. He had just heart for all man, and so open to give himself, so open so willing to be there, serving God and man. I truly loved Nat, and this is just so hard, but at the same time I am so encouragedâ€¦ he ran the course, he finished the race, he pressed on toward the goal to the end and now he is part of the cloud of witnesses encouraging us. Amen
