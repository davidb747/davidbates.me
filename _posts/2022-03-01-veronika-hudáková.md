Brother Nat and his family greatly enriched the church life in Slovakia during the years when they lived in Bratislava. Not only the church life here, but mine and my brother’s childhoods would not have been the same without brother Nat. Throughout the years, my family traveled to Bratislava for meetings and conferences, where my brother and I could enjoy the company of Nat’s family and have so many wonderful moments together. My fondest memories come from the children’s camps that happened every summer, where brother Nat, or “Uncle Nat” as we kids called him, gave us many valuable lessons about the Lord and His purpose and along with other saints, opened up the Word of God to us. Memories of brother Nat playing the guitar, doing our morning exercises with us, and leading us closer and closer to the Lord with other saints during these camps will always stay etched into my heart. I thank the Lord for brother Nat and everything he and his family has done for the Lord in Slovakia. I cannot imagine my childhood without brother Nat. Uncle Nat and aunt Wanchi shaped my view on the church life, made me feel welcomed on every visit, and brought Deborah, Bethany and Joseph into mine and my brother’s life. Deborah has truly been my best friend in the Lord, my companion, and my dear sister ever since we met. I praise the Lord that now, our companionship- despite the distance- can continue to grow and flourish in Him.
Praise the Lord for brother Nat, his service, and the sweetness and comfort that he always brought with him wherever he went.
