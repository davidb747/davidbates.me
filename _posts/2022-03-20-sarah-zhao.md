When I came to Sacramento, I barely knew anyone. My families were all far away. He’s always my emergency contact on paper and in fact. He’s the person I go to when I have questions in the truth, in service, in Christian experience and in human living, when I don’t have the strength to pray, when I cannot break through, when I’m stuck in my mind, when I’m hurt in my soul. His spirit was very strong and exercised, but he never made me feel bad for being weak or making mistakes. When I was single, when my parents were far away, he was my support, my shepherd, and my dad, leading me to my heavenly Father. 

His living taught us to give ourselves to the ministry and to the church. He always encouraged us to memorize the ministry. I can’t forget his bright countenance when we recited verses, footnotes or conference banners to him. And I remember the first time he complimented me was because I sat on the roadside to talk to a young girl. He encouraged me to shepherd people regardless of their situation and background. 

If I saw the vision of a God-man living in the training, I saw the living out of it in bro Nat, from the first time I met him till his last breath. I pray that the Lord would train me and so many to follow his pattern to give ourselves fully and absolutely to the Lord and His purpose
