Welcome to TransSim, my friends!

I finally spent some time building up this TransSim blog since I found it is really struggling for me to study the simulation tools for Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS).  

Basically, Matlab and Python were the main programmings languages that I used for my PhD study on wireless sensor networks (WSNs), and, they were enough for verifying my algorithms. I admitted that I should spend more language exploring other programming languages and simulation platforms during my PhD. Then, when I started my job on studying ITS last year, I found I have to deal with more than two software platforms (SUMO and OMNeT++) and use the frustrating C++. Besides, understanding the source codes from others or projects also takes some time. Thus, if are a new PhD student, plan ahead and don't just focus on the reading and preparing your survey paper. Professional knowledge, programming skill, mathematics foundation and determination are all essential for your research and career.

Hope this TransSim blog can somehow solve your problems in simulating and studying ITS. Send me an email if you have something to communicate. Also, u could follow the project I am working on to see if anything is interesting to you and follow TSSG.
