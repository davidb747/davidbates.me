title: "Scaling NER at Twitter"
tags: nlp deep-learning

I recently celebrated my first work anniversary at [Twitter Cortex](https://cortex.twitter.com/en.html). Looking back, I had tremendous growth as a ML modeler and engineer, working on the Named Entity Recognition (NER) systems at Twitter. I was fortunate to have the opportunity to share what I learned at [O'Reilly AI San Jose 2019](https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca-2019/public/schedule/detail/76804) and [ODSC West 2019](https://odsc.com/speakers/named-entity-recognition-at-scale-with-deep-learning/), where I gave an overview of NER as well as the modeling and engineering challenges we faced running such model at Twitter scale. 

The slides for the talks can be found [here](https://sijunhe-blog.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/files/ODSC_West_NER_Slides.pdf).
