Hi, I’m **David Bates** — a Physics graduate from Imperial College London with a passion for **sports analytics**, **machine learning**, and using data to solve real-world problems.

I’ve applied statistical modelling and predictive techniques to sports like **snooker** and **American football**, building tools such as:
- 🧠 A custom **Elo rating system** to track and predict NFL team performance
- 🎯 A machine learning model (DeepCue) that forecasts snooker outcomes using historical performance and matchup dynamics

My broader experience includes:
- 📊 **Data analysis** and **automation** for over 100 clients at Pro-Force Ltd
- 📁 Building **reporting pipelines** using Python, SQL, and Excel VBA
- 📉 Exploring large datasets in fields like **climate science**, through my Master’s thesis using satellite data and statistical inference

Right now, I’m working on expanding my portfolio of applied data science projects, especially at the intersection of sports, finance, and technology. This blog is where I post analysis, visualisations, and reflections on those projects.
