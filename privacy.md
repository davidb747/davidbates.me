This Privacy Policy outlines how we (Mosquito Games) collect, use, and protect your data.

### Data we collect
In this age of [surveillance capitalism](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/03/harvard-professor-says-surveillance-capitalism-is-undermining-democracy/), we endeavor to collect as little data about you as possible.

1. We use [EmailOctopus](https://emailoctopus.com) to collect the email address you give us when you subscribe to our mailing list.[^1]
  - We can and do access this data to send you emails, also via EmailOctopus.
  - For more details, see EmailOctopus' [Privacy Policy](https://emailoctopus.com/legal/privacy).
2. This website is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), which may log your IP address and other information for security purposes.
  - We do not (and cannot) access this data.
  - For more details, see GitHub's [Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement#github-pages).
3. This website is served around the world through the [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) content delivery network. Cloudflare may log your IP address and other information for maintenance and security purposes.
  - We do not (and cannot) access this data.
  - We can and do access aggregate metrics about this website using Cloudflare's [analytics tool](https://www.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/).
  - For more details, see Cloudflare's [Privacy Policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/).

### How we use your data

__1. To provide email updates__

We use the personal information you provide when you subscribe to our mailing list solely to send you occasional email updates. These updates may contain news on the development and sale of _1819 Singapore_, opportunities for you to support game development, or information about related products or services.

We do not engage in [email tracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_tracking).

We never use your personal data for other purposes. With the exception of our mailing list provider (EmailOctopus), we never transfer, exchange, or sell your personal data to any other third party.

If you unsubscribe from our mailing list, you will stop receiving our email updates, but EmailOctopus does not automatically delete your personal data. Thus, we periodically clean our mailing list to irrevocably delete the personal data of those who have unsubscribed.

If you wish to have your personal data irrevocably deleted on demand, please send an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@mosquito.games">privacy [at] mosquito [dot] games</a>.

__2. To perform simple analytics__

We use Cloudflare's web analytics tool to understand our audience as a whole. We are interested in questions like: which countries do our audience live in? How are they learning about us and finding our website?

We do not wish to track you, or even collect data that allows us to track you. That is why we use Cloudflare: unlike other web analytics tools, Cloudflare does not download cookies or other files to your devices, and gives us access only to aggregated metrics.

### Links

When you click on links on this website, you may be directed to a third-party website or application, in which case you (and your personal data) are no longer governed by our Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites or applications, and encourage you to read their privacy statements.

##### A note about YouTube

We host our video content on [a YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH-7o_XX45rgeuBIVGzRhkA), as it is still the least bad option for creators in terms of reliability, affordability, popularity, and ease of use.

Unfortunately, YouTube---through cookies, your Google account identity, and other tracking methods---collects, processes, and makes available to us a disturbingly large amount of personal information, down to their "best guess" of your gender and age bracket. YouTube does not provide us with the option to stop collecting this data.

We do not use, analyze, transfer, or sell this data. We try not to look at it.

Furthermore, we have disabled [personalized ads](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2549116?hl=en) on our YouTube channel. This means that ads will not be served to you based on the personal data YouTube has already collected from you.

At present, we do not monetize our YouTube videos. Should that change in the future, we will continue to disable personalized ads, even though doing so may "significantly reduce" our channel's revenue.

### Changes to this Policy
We may modify this Privacy Policy at any time, without prior notice. We usually only do so when we start, stop, or update how we are using a third-party service. Changes to this Privacy Policy take effect immediately upon their posting on this page.

### Contact us
If you wish to access, amend, or delete any personal information we have about you; register a complaint; or simply ask questions, please send an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@mosquito.games">privacy [at] mosquito [dot] games</a>.


[^1]: Before 24 October 2021, we used [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com) to collect your email address, first name, and last name. We have since migrated our mailing list to EmailOctopus, and irrevocably deleted your personal data from Mailchimp's systems (see their [Deletion Policy](https://mailchimp.com/help/delete-contacts/)). Thus, moving forward, EmailOctopus is the sole third-party service we share your email information with.
