## The problem

[Musicalia](https://musicalinasse.be){:target="_blank"} is a Musical school based in Asse. They regularly produce musical shows, and previously distributed those to the audience via DVDs. This is not very practical however, and they were in need of a way to distribute the videos online. The shows should only be available to the people that bought a ticket to this service.

## The solution

A video streaming service that consists of 2 pieces: an **admin** site, and a **streaming** site. The admin site allows the staff of Musicalia to grant access to videos to the users that bought a ticket. The streaming site can be accessed by the people who are registered to the service. **Keycloak** was used to provide identity management. **Vimeo** was used to store and stream the videos.

## Feedback

*I would like to describe this collaboration as an exclusively positive experience. Willem has shown a great interest for our organization from the start, and he has done the necessary research to acquire a good feeling with our sector.*

*Without much back and forth, he constructed a solution, exactly fitted to the problem that we wanted to solve. During the startup of the project, I had the feeling that our opinion was important to him, and that he was always available to help us.*

*The most unique thing about his way of working, is that the site he created is something our people can easily work with independently.*

*Also the fact that we haven't had any extra costs to this project, and that we received exactly what was promised at the beginning, is greatly appreciated.*
