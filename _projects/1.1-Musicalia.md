## The problem

[Musicalia](https://musicalinasse.be){:target="_blank"} is a Musical school based in Asse. They regularly produce musical shows, and previously distributed those to the audience via DVDs. This is not very practical however, and they were in need of a way to distribute the videos online. The shows should only be available to the people that bought a ticket to this service.

## The solution

A video streaming service that consists of 2 pieces: an **admin** site, and a **streaming** site. The admin site allows the staff of Musicalia to grant access to videos to the users that bought a ticket. The streaming site can be accessed by the people who are registered to the service. **Keycloak** was used to provide identity management. **Vimeo** was used to store and stream the videos.
