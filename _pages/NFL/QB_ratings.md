title: "NFL Quarterback Ratings"

This is where I will post updates on NFL Quarterback Ratings.

The goal is for ratings to update after each match, reflecting the result of the previous weeks matches.

The ratings will be a complex variant of an Elo model - taking into consideration every aspect of a quarterbacks play.

_I am currently working on this and expect an MVP to be published by 13th August"_
