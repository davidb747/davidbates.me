Hello there! I'm **Konark Karna**.

I am a graduate from **Northumbria University**, UK with **MSc Advanced Computer Science**.

My area of interest lies in the field of Artificial Intelligence in general, and Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning in particular. However, many of my chosen projects and the dissertation at University were focussed on applied machine learning, and NLP.

Currently, I'm living in *doldrum* and looking for a Research / PhD position.

Among other worldly things :<br>
I'm a huge fan of France24, DW News New channel, and DW Documentary (religiously watch F24 Debate with the host Fran√ßois Picard). Loves reading books - currently reading *In the Name of Rome*
