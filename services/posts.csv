3/1/2022,saints,post,Jana Štefuriková ,"Bratislava, Slovakia","The Lord desires that our earthen vessels be emptied, so that He can fill them with Himself for His purpose. That is why we hear such encouragement that the Lord wants to transform us from “hero to zero”. It sounds better in English… “From hero to zero”. It amuses us… However, the practical denial of ourselves, our natural life — including what we own in any form to make us proud “heroes” is not always easy and enjoyable. Nevertheless, we pay the price according to our capabilities and circumstances, to be emptied of ourselves so that we can gain Christ, to express Christ, to be built into Christ in the local churches all over the world into one corporate vessel.
This was also the way of our Brother Nat, who lived a family life, Christian life, and church life among us to gain Christ. We saw it. We experienced it with him. We helped each other go from “hero” to “zero”, whether the “hero” was visible to us more or less on the outside. We longed for “zero”.

Today, however, I would like to apply the word ‘hero’ to Brother Nat in a different, positive sense. He was not afraid to follow the Lord, even from his youth. He bravely set out to follow Him with his wife and small children in service in Europe. He also served diligently and persevered daily where he had just been living. He paid the price until the end. And on his way, like some heroes, he lost the most valuable…
Thank you for your testimony, Brother Nat."
3/1/2022,saints,post,Endy Štefurik,"Bratislava, Slovakia","What I remember very clearly when I was thinking about my first meeting with Nat was his smile :) It was also his joy to meet me, a new brother in the Lord. I met him with such sincere joy throughout his entire service in Slovakia. Whenever he met new believers or complete strangers, he always had an open heart to serve them, to take care of them, to help them, and to devote time to them…

He was also a pattern for me in his approach to the truth, to the word of God. I always saw him take the word for himself, take the word as his source, and consequently, what he spoke, portrayed His love for the Lord and the saints. Whether he spoke in meetings or with someone individually, his words brought grace to the listeners.

We often were on the streets among the people talking about the Lord, handing out books, and sharing the gospel. I specifically remember one case when we were in Brno handing out books for free. Nat tried to find the best place to set up our table where we could spread out our books. He moved this table from place to place, over and over again. I said to myself, “Does it matter where we put the table? There are people everywhere.” Nevertheless, I followed him and did not express my opinion. On that day, we distributed the most books and leaflets from the entire distribution. This was one of the many situations in which the Lord caused growth in me through Brother Nat. There were many such situations during our joint activities in Slovakia. Everything was for encouragement, the building and the pleasure. Our brother lived and gave his life for Christ and the church.

Thank you, Lord Jesus, for the privilege of knowing this humble servant of Yours and his family. Thank you for this example, a pattern of faith and love that is worth following. I pray that his service in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and the United States will continue to bring multiple fruit.

3/1/2022,saints,post,Brother Petr Novák and the saints from Letovice,"Letovice, Czech Republic","I met Brother Nat for the first time in Brno, where the saints used to meet once a month. The saints came from Prague, Bratislava, and surrounding towns. I didn't like going there at first. My wife, who already went to these meetings, told me that after the meeting we would stop at a hypermarket… and I liked that, so I started going with her. But as time went on, these meetings brought life to me and I began to enjoy attending the meetings of the saints. In 2010, I was baptized by Brother Nat and that was a new beginning for me. Brother Nat had a burden for me in his heart, which is why he started to visit my family regularly, either with brothers or by himself. He would travel 200km from Bratislava by car or bus in all kinds of weather. Often there was snow and ice everywhere. At first I didn't really understand why Nat had so much burden in his heart for me, but praise the Lord that he was visiting and bringing me life, the life of Christ. Hallelujah! Then we began to meet with others who were interested at our house, at Sister Martha's and Sister Vera's houses in Letovice, and at the Reznik family’s house.

I remember that at the beginning of Brother Nat´s visits we all would throw our problems at him and he would always smile and say, “Oh Lord Jesus!”, take the hymnal and look for a song to sing with us. The problems diminished and we were able to enjoy Christ as life together. He also taught us how to pray-read the Word of God and enjoy the ministry of Watchman Nee and Witness Lee.

Praise the Lord, in June 2012, the church was planted in Letovice and we were able to have our first Lord's Table. It was a great honor and still is a great feast. We think (and I write this for all the saints of Letovice) that if Nat had not started to visit me, there would not be the church in this town.

We will remember Brother Nat as someone who brought the gospel to us. He was ready in season and out of season. He was a servant of Christ with much love for the Church. We are very sorry to see him go, but our Lord knows and took him to Himself.

We bless his entire family and we are grateful that we were able to know them as well. Praise the Lord Jesus Christ, He is Victor! 
With the love of Christ on behalf of the saints from Letovice, "
3/1/2022,saints,post,Eva Nováková,"Letovice, Czech Republic","I am very grateful to the Lord Jesus that I was able to meet Brother Nat in my lifetime. He baptized me and also my son Petr. Brother Nat always encouraged me to call on the name of the Lord, especially when I had a failure. His heart was full of Christ's love, grace and life supply. Thank You, Lord Jesus, for this precious brother. Amen."
3/1/2022,saints,post,"Martin and Monika Blizman, with children Eunika, Sára and Michal","Prešov, Slovakia","With great sadness and sorrow in our hearts we received the news of the unexpected departure of our dear brother Nat, and although we did not know him as long as other brothers and sisters in the Czech Republic and Slovakia (who worked with him and his family when building the foundation of the church in these localities), even the brief time we spent with him at the children’s Bible camp and conferences was enough so that the traces of Christ's love and His gentle care seen in him would remain with us forever. We will never forget his smile and the teaching of the Word, in which he had so much knowledge. Yet, he was always teaching in such a humble way in a spirit of meekness. Everything he did testified that he truly loved the Lord and served Him with all his heart, all his soul, and all his mind. Therefore, we have no doubt that he is still with the Lord even now, just at a different place. Nevertheless, we will miss him very much. We are thankful to God for his service to the church. Nathaniel Kong was a precious gift to us."
3/1/2022,saints,post,"Jana, Peťo, and Hanka Tesákovci","Zvolen, Slovakia","I met Brother Nat at the church meetings in Bratislava, when I was 18-19 years old. I would be lying if I said I knew him very well. Actually, I did know his children and his wife, and I admired his view of family, of the church, and of God. I feel sorry that Peto, my husband, did not have the chance to meet him. 

I probably have never seen Brother Nat sad. Of course, when he was talking about important things, he didn't smile then, but even in that situation, there was such a calming power coming from within. Therefore, I knew that what he was saying was not of his own nature but were words that the Lord Himself was speaking to me, to us… trying to calm us, to direct us, and to instruct us. In short, whatever was needed in that situation. When I close my eyes I remember exactly what his American Czech-Slovak was like. He never said anything extra and he always made sense, whether it was a 5 minute sharing at the Lord's Table or a 40 minute message at a conference. The Lord found a channel in our brother through which He was able to infuse into my spirit and I believe into other people's spirits as well.

Even though Brother Nat was quite busy, I always saw him taking care of his family, his wife, and his children. They always had activities planned that he and Wanchi took care of together. In this too, they are a pattern to me to this day, in regards to our daughter Hana, to keep her busy with activities and to expand her skills as well. At the same time, for me and Pete to support one another.
I don't even know how to conclude, because the news of Brother Nat´s departure surprised and shocked me. Lord, be peace, rest and full supply to the whole family. Cover Wanchi, Joseph, Deborah, and Bethany with Yourself. May Your words, Lord, sown by our brother, bring forth a harvest.

3/1/2022,saints,post,František Č,"Prague, Czech Republic","I met Brother Nat sometime in 2000 during a fellowship at our home. I got to know him as a humble person, always willing to help in various matters. He even participated in helping us with the new roof on our house, so whenever I see our roof I can remember Brother Nat. One time, we served together visiting the saints in some places in the Czech Republic. He will remain permanently in my memories!

3/1/2022,saints,post,Tomáš Vaculín,"Prague, Czech Republic","I first met Brother Nat and his family during the summer of 2001. It was around that time when the Kong family had moved to the Czech Republic. Joseph and Deborah were small children at that time. Brother Nat was a friendly brother and I still remember a friendly talk we had on one of our first encounters. I think it was in the Kong's home when I saw something concerning the church life. It was at a time when several saints were gathered together in the Kong's home for a meal and informal fellowship. After that and through the following years, I received shepherding care and hospitality from Nat and his family. My last in person contact with brother Nat was in the autumn of 2021, when he and Joseph visited Prague. Brother Nat was a friendly, approachable, and humble brother. Brother Nat helped me to see the God ordained way as something that is doable, even when there are limitations. Thank the Lord for brother Nat and his portion."
3/1/2022,saints,post,Anička Bucholcerova,"Bílovice nad Svitavou, Czech Republic","Brother Nat used to come and see us when we were in college. Irenka Ř., Jana H., Daniel Ř, and I used to meet with him. We would read the Bible and something from the ministry together. It was very nice that Brother Nat personally took care of us in such a way. Whenever I had concerns, he would encourage me with this verse: “Do not let your heart be troubled.” While traveling within the United States, he and his whole family took us on trips to the national parks in California. Sister Wanchi was amazing at the Bible camps in Slovakia, teaching the children verses and making fun activities and pictures with the children."
3/1/2022,saints,post,Daniel Baláž,"Košice, Slovakia","I know Brother Nat and his family only by hearsay, so my testimony of his life and work is only a testimony of what the saints have testified. We joined the church life in Košice in 2016, when Brother Nat was no longer living here. The saints spoke of him as a brother who was full of Christ, always being there for the saints. I remember how the saints would always ask in the meetings: ""Do you have a song?"" Later it was explained to me that it was Brother Nat who used to ask the saints for a song in that way during the meetings. Perhaps in closing, we too are very grateful for his faithful ministry. Our family is proof that his ministry has been blessed and multiplied by the Lord.

3/1/2022,saints,post,Veronika Hudáková,"Košice, Slovakia","Brother Nat and his family greatly enriched the church life in Slovakia during the years when they lived in Bratislava. Not only the church life here, but mine and my brother’s childhoods would not have been the same without brother Nat. Throughout the years, my family traveled to Bratislava for meetings and conferences, where my brother and I could enjoy the company of Nat’s family and have so many wonderful moments together. My fondest memories come from the children’s camps that happened every summer, where brother Nat, or “Uncle Nat” as we kids called him, gave us many valuable lessons about the Lord and His purpose and along with other saints, opened up the Word of God to us. Memories of brother Nat playing the guitar, doing our morning exercises with us, and leading us closer and closer to the Lord with other saints during these camps will always stay etched into my heart. I thank the Lord for brother Nat and everything he and his family has done for the Lord in Slovakia. I cannot imagine my childhood without brother Nat. Uncle Nat and aunt Wanchi shaped my view on the church life, made me feel welcomed on every visit, and brought Deborah, Bethany and Joseph into mine and my brother’s life. Deborah has truly been my best friend in the Lord, my companion, and my dear sister ever since we met. I praise the Lord that now, our companionship- despite the distance- can continue to grow and flourish in Him.
Praise the Lord for brother Nat, his service, and the sweetness and comfort that he always brought with him wherever he went.

3/1/2022,saints,post,Milada Fišnarová,"Prague, Czech Republic","I'd like to add a memory of our brother Nathaniel. Praise the Lord for such a brother who, together with other saints, ministered to us greatly in Czechia when the Lord's recovery began here. Every time I saw him, he always had a smile and a great attitude with a warm heart. You could see and feel that his heart was full of the Lord Jesus. I believe that he loved the Lord Jesus Christ with all his heart and he simply ministered His love to others. He always impressed me with an amazing peace about him. I also greatly appreciated that he learned Czech because of us, so that even those of us who do not speak English could communicate. He was a very kind brother. Praise and glory to his memory."
3/1/2022,saints,post,Oľga Bottová,Slovakia,"I didn't know Brother Nat personally, but I am very sorry for what happened. However, I know from other brothers and sisters that Brother Nat was very kind, warm-hearted and willing to help anyone. He loved the Lord and lived Christ. I wish I could have known him personally. May the Lord, by His grace and love, take care of Nat's family and all who will miss him dearly."
3/12/2022,saints,post,Hanka Ř.,"Prague, Czech Republic","Thank God for the memory of Brother Nat. He was always full of God's love and the life that flowed from him was encouraging and comforting. There was a time when I was going through some trials, sometimes being up and sometimes being down in the valley. Brother Nat told me that I should experience Christ in these situations, because the Lord Jesus works in us to make more room for God's purpose. Grace upon grace came from the Lord, and I really saw that He was the One working in us. I also have a joyful testimony… whenever Nat heard that there was interest in ministry books, he would immediately prepare a box of books and offer them with joy. Amen.

We are thankful that God called and brought Brother Nat and his family to the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Letovice (Viski), and other various places. May the seed of life arise in resurrection and spread wherever our brother had moved in Christ Jesus. Amen.
"
3/12/2022,saints,post,Adam Surjomartono,"Prague, Czech Republic","I was acquainted with Brother Nat and his family over the 13 years they were in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. I spent a lot of time with him in their home, in our home, in meetings, in the homes of the saints, on the streets handing out literature, on the road, while traveling and while serving together. Our families visited each other often and our children practically grew up together in the church life. I saw his way of living… how he conducted himself in the house of God, in his family, and in front of other people. 

Brother Nat was constituted with the ministry of the age, which he faithfully followed. Even in his spare time, I often saw him reading the Word, the life-studies, and other ministry material. I would also see him listening to messages. Thus, he had a rich deposit of truth within him, which was evident not only by his sharing in the meetings, but also in his personal contact with people. 
Brother Nat loved to sing to the Lord with the saints and often joined them on the guitar. He always encouraged others to exercise and release their spirits and voices in calling on the Lord's name, in prayer, and in singing. He also encouraged brothers and sisters to eat the Word, to receive the ministry, and to speak unashamedly in meetings. He was always ready and prepared to share the gospel with seekers and unbelievers. You could see some leaflets peeking out from his shirt pocket. 

In his interactions with people, Brother Nat was gentle and kind, and his smile warmed people up. He loved to talk with people and listen to them. Although he labored and served diligently, he never drew attention to himself. The saints greatly appreciated Brother Nat learning Czech so that he could communicate without an interpreter. He often asked me about grammar or pronunciation and then would try to use what he had learned. 
Thanks to Sister Wanchi's support, their household was always open to saints and non-believing friends. The children's Bible camps originated with the Kong family and they continue to this day. They are looked forward to every year by families and saints from both our countries.

I will forever be grateful to the Lord for Brother Nat, with assurance that his life and service will still bear much fruit for the building up of the Body of Christ.

3/12/2022,saints,post,"Katarína, Jurko, Miško Páleš","Prievidza, Slovakia","Brother Nat was a very dear and precious brother to us. I remember Brother Nat's love for my sons, Jurko and Miško. Along with other brothers, he was able to stand in as a male role model for my boys during a difficult time in our lives.
Brother Nat was shining wherever he was – at meetings in Bratislava, in Košice, in Prievidza, in Poprad, in Žilina, at children's camps, and on joint trips. His shepherding was amazing, including the patience he had in listening, even to small children. It is impossible to describe what he did… what he left in our hearts.

My parents also have not forgotten the unique visits and meetings with the saints in their apartment. We all remember the night when the brothers and Nat brought Sister Zoe to my parents’ when she needed a place to stay in Prievidza.
Our entire family extends our sincere sympathy to Sister Wanchi, Deborah, Bethany, Joseph, and all the saints in the church. We remain in prayer, and we stand with all of you in oneness with the Body. We are one, no matter where we live or what our circumstances are. We are in the Spirit, in the oneness of the Body of Christ.

3/12/2022,saints,post,David and Caroline Wang,Hong Kong,"When my wife and I received the tragic news regarding our dearest brother Nat, we were shocked and grieved beyond which any words can express. However, one thing we do know, is that our dearest brother Nat was deeply loved by the Lord. Therefore, we have no words, no question before Him, only heartaches and tears. Our grief is only comforted by the assurance that there is a crown of righteousness and a crown of life prepared for Nat, and we shall meet again in the kingdom age. O Lord, come quickly, our love is waiting for You.

Our dearest brother Nat is one in whom we found no guile, pure in heart, and poor in spirit, always ready to serve with a genuine smile. He is loved by God and man. 

We remember almost 20 years of glorious meeting and serving together in the Kong's house, in our home, and in the Sacramento meeting hall. Those joyful days when we were working together in remodeling the meeting hall, laying the sprinkler pipes and lawn around the meeting hall, and having many delicious meals and sweet fellowship with the Kong family. Those memories will be our eternal joy and encouragement for us to love the Lord and continue to run the unfinished course before the Lord's return.

Nat and the entire Kong family are so, so dear to our hearts. They are such an encouragement to us. We are honored to have known them, and we are eternally grateful for the patterns they set before us. Thank you Lord.

We want to use the words from brother Nee's hymn ""Let me love"" to describe Nat. 

""Let me love, and not be regarded;
Let me serve, and not be rewarded;
Let me labor and not be accounted;
Let me suffer and not be noticed;
'Tis the pouring, not the drinking;
'Tis the breaking, not the keeping—
A life suffering to seek others' blessing,
A life loving and true comfort giving.""

This is the testimony of our brother Nat Kong. In nothing he was put to shame. Christ is magnified in his body, whether through life or through death. Amen."
3/17/2022,saints,post,Steve and Tuyet McFaul,"San Antonio, Texas","Tuyet and I heard of the tragic event that took place in the Church in Sacramento meeting hall. We were devastated to hear that our brother and friend Nathaniel Kong was one of the victims of the shooting. We knew Nathaniel well and even served with him in Berlin, Germany in 2016. I have some fond memories of him and I walking from the meeting hall to a nearby turkish hamburger restaurant to eat the best hamburger and sweet potato fries ever (at  least we thought so), at a very reasonable price. We did that more than once. I remember also that Tuyet and I had gone out to eat with him along with several refugees for at least one dinner. He was a faithful shepherd of the refugees.

We are sure that Nathaniel touched many lives during his service to the Lord. He was a faithful brother, a good and faithful slave. We will miss him greatly, and we will keep the family in our prayers. May the Lord's grace and mercy sustain Nat's family during this very difficult time.

3/17/2022,family,post,Naomi Kong,"Tampa, Florida","It feels wrong to write this. I know in my head that God is sovereign, but in my heart there isn’t room for Uncle Nat to be remembered with stories and anecdotes, impressions and memories. He lived a lot of stories, he left a lot of memories, some big and some small. These are some of the small ones. Memories of a young girl with a really cool uncle.  

My first memory of Uncle Nat was more than a memory, it was the feeling of freedom. Before he was a dad, before he was married, he would pile all of us cousins (it was the 90s!)  into his little, white, stick shift Toyota. But these weren’t just car rides, Uncle Nat turned them into epic races against fierce opponents with a play by play, no matter how fast or slow we were going. To this day I can still feel the sensation of the acceleration and gear shift in that little white Toyota. 

He was the fun Uncle. The one who lightened the mood and actually got our dads to laugh. The only one who spent money on fun!  If you know anything about the Kongs in the 90s, you know what I’m talking about. But, everyone grows up eventually and pretty soon Uncle Nat was getting married! It was an exciting time; however, we were apprehensive about change and I distinctly remember one of our cousins conversations where we discussed if he would still be fun after he got married.  

Well, if you know Aunt Wanchi now, you can imagine how fun she was to us young cousins back in the day. Uncle Nat now had a shot gun rider, but we could still squeeze in the back. One of those car rides took us to the state fair and to my shock and bewilderment they took us to the rides area! We went to the fair a lot as kids, but never got to go on rides or eat fair food. To my even greater shock, Uncle Nat handed Marianna and I a handful of tickets. I had never had the freedom to choose my own paid fun before this. The freedom felt so wrong I couldn’t even choose! Instead of choosing for us, or riding one with us, he prompted us to pick one and eventually Marianna and I made our way over to the Ferris wheel by ourselves and I experienced another type of freedom for the first time. This may seem silly and small, but to that young girl the impact was significant, and what may seem like a small memory now was a big memory then. 

Uncle Nat was generous, and kind. He spent money on us (a big deal in the Kong family), celebrated our birthdays, gave us experiences we would have never had otherwise, but best of all, he took the time to have fun with us! 

He continued to have this impact on the family and on us kids as we grew up, even after becoming a dad himself. We also wondered if he would still be fun after becoming a dad (sorry Joseph!). We just didn’t want to lose our Uncle Nat. Our young hearts weren’t ready. But again, he didn’t disappoint. He was still the fun Uncle (and still cooler than our dads).  

We still don’t want to lose our Uncle Nat. Our adult hearts aren’t ready, even knowing he is now more free than he ever was chasing cars on a freeway with a bunch of nieces and nephews piled in the back. Thank you for giving us the gift of fun and freedom. We love you Uncle Nat. "
3/17/2022,saints,post,Jed Fehrenbach,"Boston, Massachusetts","In Spring of 2001, during my third year of college, I spent one semester studying overseas in Prague. Nat and Wanchi were already there, and I met them for the first time within my first few days of arriving, at a meeting on the Lord's day. Nat connected with me right away. He found out that I liked to play guitar, and shortly after that he gave me his personal guitar to borrow and use during my entire time there, which was several months. I was very shepherded by having his guitar to borrow, and the way was opened for me to come to the meetings and to serve by playing it. I felt like a normal functioning member within a week of arriving to a new locality, in a new country, on a different continent. This was because of Nat's immediate care and shepherding. He had a way with people that was so direct, yet so warm, caring, generous, and unassuming. I never felt pressured to serve, it was a response within because of the Lord shepherding me through Nathaniel.

Regarding Nat's passing, I struggled and cried out to the Lord for days after hearing about it. I asked the Lord many times ""Why?"". This shouldn't happen to believers, I thought, especially ones so faithful. The Lord answered me. Nat died doing what he loved - taking care of people, which is exactly what I (Jesus) did for you (all of us). This has made a very strong impression on my being. Nat's death was a grain of wheat falling into the ground, and many grains have been, and will be brought forth because of what was poured out.

Both Nat's living and his dying were such a bright shining testimony of the life of the Lord Jesus being lived out. "

3/18/2022,saints,saints,Leo and Eva Grman,"Bratislava, Slovakia","Dear Wanchi, Jožko, Deborka a Betinka, dear saints,

My wife, Eva, and I first moved to Bratislava in 2005 after we graduated from the FTTL and had some initial experience serving with other saints in London and in Warsaw. It was the fellowship in the Body which brought us back to Slovakia with another Slovak couple, Endy and Jana, who graduated from the FTT in Moscow. We joined several other couples to serve the Lord together in Slovakia. For eternity I will remain thankful for this arrangement and the care of the Body for us, who were very new in the church life and the Body life. I feel like a debtor to all these dear saints from the US and Europe who corporately took care of us while being one with the Head and with the rest of the Body. 

Two couples who moved with their children to Bratislava, Slovakia, from the Czech Republic were Adam and Soňa and brother Nat and sister Wanchi.

While we are considering our Brother Nat, one word comes up in our being repeatedly. This word is absoluteness. Serving with him for eight years, we found him to be absolute in his pursuing of the Lord and loving the church to the uttermost. For this reason, he considered the time that we gathered together for coordination to be something very precious. Frequently, even after exhausting gospel trips (which we did regularly in Czechia, Slovakia, Hungary and in Poland) brother Nat wanted to be with all of us, and he wanted to hear from us.  

During our times together he was constantly asking us how the particular saints were doing, and why certain ones did not come to the meetings. The saints and the condition of the saints were always on his heart. When we were visiting the brothers and sisters across the country in Prievidza, Žilina, Košice, Prešov or Poprad and other places, he was always traveling with us, and was one with us in taking care of them. Today, I would say he genuinely loved to be with us and take care of the saints with us.

We also admire his faithfulness when he traveled to a small town in the Czech Republic, Letovice, every Friday afternoon to meet a few saints there. He went there no matter what the season and what the weather was like. I believe the saints in Letovice are eternally thankful for his care. 

In the church meetings he was not seen as a brother with many talents. But he was always very zealous in his spirit, faithful, loving and absolute. He was shining Christ and diligently speaking God's word to the saints. Moreover, his singing to the Lord is unforgettable. It was always sweet. Last but not least he loved the ministry of this age. Brother Nat was constituted with this ministry, one with the Word, and faithfully distributing it to all people. To me brother Nat was a brother who was able to express the Lord's love without partiality. 

If you please allow one more sweet memory, which lives among all the saints in Slovakia, even among those who never met our dear brother. Brother Nat learned the Czech language. Even though his Czech was far from being what most would consider perfect, in his shepherding he never hesitated to use it. Many of the meetings, if not all of them, he started with a question: “Máš něco píseň,” which translated back to English would literally mean, “Do you have something song?” Imperfect as it was, until now in some of our home meetings, especially in those which start in a sweet, and homey atmosphere you can hear someone asking: “Máš něco píseň, Do you have something song?”

Lord, we thank you that we were able to know brother Nat in the person of Christ and be a small part of his life on earth. May our mutual experiences remain for an eternity.

This song is the experience of my youngest son, Nathaniel Kong. He was born during the flood in October 1962. Rising flood waters prevented travel to the hospital so with the help of our backdoor neighbor who was a nurse and the ambulance driver, Nat came into the world before my eyes. Mother and baby were transported from the waiting ambulance to the hospital via dump truck. Because he born outside the hospital, he was placed in a closet in the maternity ward rather than in the nursery. His birth was indeed special.

In December 1962 our family went to Los Angeles to attend Witness Lee's first conference in this country. Nat was the youngest attendee at 3 months old. 

After college, He was led by the Lord to attend the Fulltime Training in Taipei with many other young believers. 

Later, Nat was blessed with a dear wife who was willing to go along with him as he followed the Lord's leading to go to Eastern Europe for the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. When they returned from Europe in 2013 he continued to serve the Lord with the students on the college campus and with many others of various backgrounds.

When I received news of Nat's passing, in grief, all I could do is call on the Lord.

In our sorrow and grief, we have been comforted and consoled by the visits, cards, and messages from many brothers and sisters, far and near, as well as our friends and our neighbors.

3/18/2022,family,post,Dan Kong,"Sacramento, California","We grew up in a home where Christ, and by extension His Body, the church, was central. However, I noticed that the Lord started to do a deeper work in Nat during the mid 70s when he was around 13 or 14 years old. At that time, the church here would gather with other churches in the Bay area, in Berkeley, every Friday evening, for what we call the ministry station. There we had the respeaking of the life-study of Genesis, that was being released to His body at that time. Nat was deeply touched by all the sharing, dove into the rich ministry flowing out, and that has governed the course of his life ever since.

With the change in the world situation, and the opening up of Eastern Europe to the gospel, in 2000, Nat and his family jumped at the opportunity to go. Leaving their jobs, Nat & Wanchi gave their next 13 years to serve the Lord there. In typical Kong fashion, Nat endeavored to be as self-supporting as possible, desiring not to place any burden on the church. He has faithfully maintained that practice from that time, all the way to the present time.

Nat’s heart has been & continues to be with the saints in Eastern Europe. Despite, the need to return to this country for the children’s college education, I have heard him, on numerous occasions, express his desire to return there to serve more, once the children’s education was taken care of.

Nat’s heart was for the spread of the Lord’s testimony on this earth and the building up of His body, to prepare the way for His soon return.

3/18/2022,family,post,Joanna Kong,"Yorba Linda, California","Nat and I were the youngest in our family. Growing up, I would always agree to race my kid brother because I knew I would win. But as we got older and I calculated that I might not be able to win anymore, I stopped racing him. I never dreamed that my little brother would finish his race course before I did. 

When we both began to love and pursue the Lord as teenagers, I would be the first to agree that Nat loved the Lord more than I did. Even though we both later attended the inaugural term of the Fulltime Training in Taipei, Taiwan in 1986, I knew his dedication to serve the Lord was more intense than mine. When volunteers were needed to excavate a tunnel in the basement of our training center to enlarge the kitchen facilities, he would always be among the first to stand up to volunteer. I remember seeing a photo of him after one shift of tunnel digging, grinning from ear to ear, covered from head to toe with Taipei mud. Near the end of that term of training, when most of us trainees were too exhausted to get up at 5 am for morning exercise, yes, there was Nat, among the hardy few, still making the run from the training center to Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Park. 

Although Nat has finished his course, may his life of loving the Lord and serving the Lord continue to be a pattern to all of us.

3/18/2022,family,post,Wanchi Kong,"Sacramento, California","What touched me the most about Nat and what captured my heart is his absolute love for the Lord and the ministry of this age. Our first date in a park was in 1994 right after the Chinese Speaking Conference where the high peak of the divine revelation was first released. While we were walking, he recited the 4 banners in Chinese. I was so impressed that his Chinese was not that good but he tried so hard to memorize it. That showed how much he loves and desires to be constituted with the ministry. 

One time we went to the beach and I asked if he could sing a love song to me. I was expecting some popular love song such as “Can’t help falling in love with you.” But he said “I don’t know any love song but I will sing this to you.” The song he sang was hymn 546 “I love the Lord but with no love of mine, for I have none to give.” Shortly after that, he asked me “should we get engaged first and get to know each other more or should we get to each other more and get engaged?” I thought to myself “Is that a proposal? Do I have a choice to say no?” He is absolute in his love for me also. Then you know the rest of the story.

In May 2000, the brothers shared about the renewed burden of migration to Eastern. Nat sensed that the Lord was calling him to move to Europe. He said he never had any thought or burden to move to Europe. But one time while he was praying for the Lord to send the workers to Eastern Europe, that verse came to him in Isaiah “Whom should I send? Who will go for me?”  and the Lord touched him “how about you?”. When he told me about his feeling to move to Europe, I was hesitant at first because I had a great job and I just gave birth to our second child. But he was absolute in following the Lord’s calling. So he told me that if it’s too hard for me to move, he will go first. I can come later if I want to. I know that nothing will deter his decision to move to Europe. So both of us dropped our jobs and took our two small children to move to Prague which we knew nothing about. I am so thankful that I followed Nat as he followed the Lord. The thirteen years we spent in Europe serving the Lord were the best years of my life.

I always feel that He is my rich Boaz kinsman-redeemer because I came from an unbelieving family and the Kong family has such rich spiritual inheritance. There is this song from the Bible Camp “Boaz was an extra-special person” that Nat loved. He would play guitar and sing this song again and again. The first stanza says “Boaz was an extra-special person, He was a close kinsman of Naomi. He was rich in wealth and full of abundance and was full of generosity. Though he lived during the time of Judges with its dark and evil history, he was one so pure in conduct and so high in his morality.” That is a true description of Nat. 

The first time I went to see my father-in-law after this happened, he said “when Nat was born, he hit the newspaper headline. When he died, he also hit the newspaper headline. He is very special.“ My father –in-law was right. I believe if there were newspaper during the time of the Lord Jesus, both his birth and death would hit the newspaper headline also. The first verse came to me after I heard the news was John 10: 11 when the Lord said” I am the good Shepherd; the good Shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.”  Nat died of being a good shepherd as the Lord Jesus was. He is truly an extra-special person because he lived out the life of the most extraordinary person – the Lord Jesus. I am blessed and privileged to be such an extra-special person’s heir of the grace of life for 27 years. For this I am eternally grateful. Nat broke his alabaster flask of ointment and poured it upon the Lord as Mary did.  It is not a waste but a noble deed on the Lord and a fragrant testimony of His sweetness. May we also be those who love the Lord and waste ourselves upon the Lord as He is altogether lovely and worthy of such offering.

3/18/2022,family,post,Jessica Kong,"Sacramento, California","Every kid should be lucky enough to have a fun uncle and Uncle Nat was that uncle.  Before he was married, he lived around the corner from us. When he’d show up unannounced, he didn’t knock like a normal person.  Instead he’d shout, “Little pig, little pig let me in!” And he’d stand on the front porch huffing and puffing with so much enthusiasm we almost believed he could really blow that door in.  

One evening, Uncle Nat showed up at our door and handed me a grocery bag saying, “Happy Birthday.” I opened the bag to find three books; All About Horses, King of the Wind, and The Black Stallion.  Then, he handed me the return slip from the library, “Make sure you return these…” he said.

The gift that still means the most to me was those borrowed books from the library.  Someone once said that loving others looks like loving what they love and Uncle Nat really knew how to love a young girl that felt guilty about loving anything so worldly as horses.

Uncle Nat’s favorite song was written by a fellow Norte del Rio grad you may have heard of, Lee Greenwood.  Norte del Rio doesn’t exist anymore, but to get an idea, it was in the middle of Del Paso Heights.  Uncle Nat’s classmates jokingly called him, “Blood.”  Out of blood territory came Uncle Nat’s favorite song: God Bless the USA; the thought behind which is that what you love is worth fighting for and worth dying for.  Uncle Nat loved his life.  He loved giving.  And perhaps we should all be lucky enough to go out with our boots on, doing what we love, like Uncle Nat.

Because the Kong family was going on in the Lord, it was possible for my family and I to go on with the Lord. It is not a small thing that your family were willing to be in the Czech Republic. That experience of Christ has been builded into the Body and now many are able to do what was once thought impossible.

3/19/2022,family,post,Joseph Kong,"Munich, Germany","Anyone who knows me and my parents knows that I’m definitely more like my dad than my mom, but I didn’t realize how many habits and mannerisms I had picked up from my dad until I realized I was playing sudoku on the subway in Munich on my way to school. Most people probably don't know this, but in his down time my dad loved to play sudoku while listening to the news.

My dad was shy, unassuming, and maybe a little bit awkward, but he had a big heart, he was absolute in his love for the Lord, and he was faithful in his service. Because my dad was shy, he very rarely expressed his affection towards us in words, but I think I can speak for myself and my two sisters when I say that we never doubted that he loved us and was proud of us. One of my most vivid memories is my dad coming to some of my soccer games despite him not having any interest in the sport, and I don’t think he’d ever compliment me after the game; he would always just point out what I could have done better or what I should have done differently, but I knew that was just his way of expressing that he was proud of me. 

My dad was the constant in my life that I could depend on, both spiritually and throughout all the things in life. I never wavered in my Christian faith because I had my dad as a pattern and he never wavered in his love for the Lord. If I needed help with something or didn’t know what to do, my dad would be the first person I would call. I mentioned I get my personality and habits from my dad, but he also taught me a lot of the skills I possess. He taught me how to ride a bike and how to drive. He taught me how to play chess well and he would spend hours playing and analyzing games with me after my tournaments. He took me to practice batting and catching fly balls and bought a football to teach me how to throw a good spiral. Whenever I practiced playing hymns on the piano, he would drop whatever he was doing, pick up his guitar, and sing and play along with whatever I was playing. The older us kids got, the more we realized that he loved to be involved in whatever we were doing. 

Apart from being an awesome dad, my dad was absolutely faithful in his service to the Lord. As part of his labor, he would go on long distribution trips, go to different conferences, or visit the homes of the saints. As a little kid, I didn’t really know why he was gone or what he did. It wasn’t until the past week or two as I was reading the testimonies from the saints in Europe and going through old photos and videos he had made that I realized the impact he had on people and the faithfulness with which he served the Lord. This was the way he was—hidden, unassuming, but steadfast and absolute in his labor. 

As we were going through old pictures and videos these past couple of weeks, my sister said something which stuck with me. She said this loss is probably equally hard on the team he was serving with here as much as it is for us, because he was like a father to them too. After reading different testimonies, I realized he was a father to many other saints as well. So I’d like to end with a few verses from 1 Corinthians 4 which I think describe my dad very well. This is the apostle Paul speaking to the Corinthian believers

1 Cor. 4:1  A man should account us in this way, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.
1 Cor. 4:2  Here, furthermore, it is sought in stewards that one be found faithful.
1 Cor. 4:15  For though you have ten thousand guides in Christ, yet you do not have many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.
I can just praise God for His sovereignty and blessing in placing me in this family and setting such a pattern before me.

3/19/2022,family,post,Marianna Kong,"Rohenrt Park, California","Uncle Nat was always the “cool uncle”, the fun one. He was first person to ever spend money buying tickets for my cousin Naomi & I to go on rides at the county fair. I know that this sounds like a totally ordinary childhood experience, but coming from an upbringing where we didn’t splurge on entertainment, this was a huge deal and left us feeling absolutely special.

He spent time with us doing things we loved. One of the Kong kids favorite pastimes was hanging out at the creek in Howe Park catching crawdads to keep as pets. Uncle Nat joined us once and was so dedicated to helping us lure out this big crawdad that he got onto a stump in the middle of the creek and ended up falling into the water. He always gave 100% to whatever he did.

He was the most positive and enthusiastic serving one. I don't remember much about the 6th grade conference, but I will always remember Uncle Nat playing the guitar and leading our singing. He had us sing the song “what is living all about” faster and faster and faster until he broke not one, but two guitar strings. Like I said, he always gave 100%.

Before moving to Europe, Uncle Nat would help with the semi-annual video trainings in Sacramento. I remember how he printed out the banners in an outlined font and asked some of us children who were hanging out at the meeting hall to help him color in the outlined letters. When completed the banners were far from perfect, obviously having been colored in by children, but he hung them up in the video training room anyways. Now he was probably just trying to conserve the meeting hall printer ink supply, but in doing so he was also helping us feel useful and involved in the church life.

His care was so normal, and his shepherding so human. When living in Massachusetts, I met a brother who had studied abroad in Prague during college. He told me how my uncle Nat found out he liked playing guitar, then lent him his personal guitar for the semester. This helped the brother come to all the meetings (because he now had the guitar) and cultivate his function as a member in the body.

1 Cor 9:22b says “to all men I have become all things that I might by all means save some.” This was my uncles testimony. Whether to children, or college students or any other age group, in various life situations, Uncle Nat was able to meet us with God’s love and care.

3/20/2022,saints,post,Alex Gonzalez,"Sacramento, California","I served on the Sacramento Campus team with brother Nat the last two years. But I first met Nat my senior year in college through the Christian students club, and his home was one of the first homes I went to as I was entering church life. It was his home that I could really see a life here in, he was just so inviting, and welcoming. He really had a heart for the students, and was such a pattern for me. 

After college I spoke with him about going to full time training in Anaheim and he was just so happy and had a big smile. He was just so supportive. And after a year in the training I shared with him about wanting to serve full time, and he asked what I thought about serving in Sacramento. I was just so happy when he asked me to consider Sacramento.  

Brother Nat was a pattern to me in serving full time. He was more than just a pattern, he was my spiritual father, caring for me, encouraging me to continue serving the Lord. Many times he would call me when I was discouraged and just listen, and pray with me. In his life and living I could really see what it is to serve the Lord full time, in a long term way. He had just heart for all man, and so open to give himself, so open so willing to be there, serving God and man. I truly loved Nat, and this is just so hard, but at the same time I am so encouraged… he ran the course, he finished the race, he pressed on toward the goal to the end and now he is part of the cloud of witnesses encouraging us. Amen

3/20/2022,saints,post,Amarisa,,"Brother Nat was a mentor, spiritual father and friend to me. From when I first entered church life he demonstrated what a God man truly is. Much of the Christ that I have he dispensed into me through his messages, practical examples, sweet singing, his kindness to my family and I, and his constant encouragement. My favorite memories will always be the college meeting messages that made me realize my true purpose by simply showing me a glove. Even after being a Christian for so many years, I had my life turned upside down from the things he would share about Christ that would cause me to have tears of joy. I realized that like many of the saints when he was speaking the Lord was speaking. Whenever he helped make a way for others the Lord was making a way for them. 

I especially loved his distinction of human history and divine history as he encouraged us that we want our life to be part of the divine history. I think of Enoch from the Bible who called upon the name of the Lord though not mentioned in depth but described as one who walked with God and was added into the divine history. How wonderful it is to be known for walking with God as our dear brother Nat. 

Some time ago I had decided that I wanted to be baptized a second time and Brother Nat had been one of the brothers to baptize me into the Triune God. It made it an even more special moment and one I will always remember. He taught me so many simple ways to spread life into  others and these are the methods I will continue to use to advance the gospel. I am one of the many fruits of the tender care of this saint. And I will continue to fight the good fight and cannot wait until the day we all arrive at the oneness. Thank you Lord for placing this brother in my life.

3/20/2022,saints,post,Chocolate Pridgen,"Sacramento, California","Our dear brother Nat had a heart for man like none other. In my time of knowing him, I was always greatly appreciative of his cherishing and supportive shepherding. To me, Nat was someone I considered to be a spiritual father figure in my life especially in my college years and even to this day. Because of that it is one the very reasons why I call the church life home today. Nat always took the time to check on me. I would’ve thought that there were always other ones he could have taken care of, and indeed there were but he always found a way. No matter what was going on in my day, he found a way to have time to fellowship with me. He was the kind of brother that made me want to fight for my times with the saints because I knew he always made himself available for me. Even when I was living alone, he would bike over to my house just to read the Morning Revival with me. It was always the little things that meant the most to me. Those moments when I knew, I truly was never alone. I’m so grateful to have known our brother and to have such a pattern in my going on. I would just like to end my thoughts with this verse Psalm 133:1 “Behold, how good and how pleasant it is / For brothers to dwell in unity!”. Thank you, to the Kong family for practically caring for me as a home away from home in all that you have done. My heart is warm and comforted by the supply you all have provided all these years. Saints, although our brother may not physically be with us anymore, may his pattern and testimony live on in us for the rest of our going on."
3/20/2022,saints,post,DC,"Sacramento, California","I’ve been serving with brother Nat at Sac State since 2015. A cherished memory I have is once we were rooming together for a weeklong conference, and a few days in, I caught on that Nat was going on morning runs and I started joining him. As a brother about 30 years younger, I was able to run faster and farther, and he would compliment me and say how he couldn’t keep up. But the problem is, I only managed to run three times that week. He, on the other hand, was up at dawn and running every morning. I was the one who couldn’t keep up. 

In the Sac State campus work, often we younger serving ones would be “running” out in front, and he would be behind the scenes, praying and cheering us on, and waiting earnestly to hear how things went. He liked to take notes when we shared, and sometimes he’d miss a name or detail and ask us to repeat because he typed a little slower and wanted to catch everything. He just loved hearing about the young people and praying for them. He also had such a broad heart, and never wanted to give up on anyone or take anyone’s name off our prayer list.

In serving together, we had roughly 3 hour morning meetings every weekday, and through 6.5 years, I just can’t remember him taking a day off, unless he was on a trip with his dear family. Sometimes, certain team members including myself would be down or not doing so well, but he didn’t criticize. Instead he just worried about us and cared for us. 

Philippians 2:16 - Holding forth the word of life, so that I may have a boast in the day of Christ that I did not run in vain nor labor in vain.
I just pray for myself and so many others our brother labored on and shepherded to keep holding forth the word of life and running the Christian race. Our finishing our Christian race victoriously would be our brother Nat’s greatest boast in the day of Christ. I’m just so thankful the Lord gave me such a gracious, generous, and forgiving older brother to be my mentor, spiritual father and running mate.

3/20/2022,saints,post,DW,"Davis, California","Nat is my brother, my co-worker and my friend. I have known Nat and his family for almost 46 years. When my wife and I migrated to Sacramento in 1976 with our daughter Kelly, Nat was only about 13 years old, a Jr. higher, the youngest child  of Jonathan and Joan Kong.  

When I first met Nat, I was amazed that such a young brother knew the Bible so well and could speak the ministry so clearly. It seemed that he was in every meeting that I was in, and often functioned better than I could.

Nat went on to complete his education with a masters degree in Mechanical engineering. Nat was among the first to attend the fulltime training in Taiwan, and several years later, followed the Lord’s calling to serve Him fulltime in Europe.

When Nat and his family went to Europe, for years we would read his emails in the prayer meetings to stand with them in prayer. Sometimes I would ask myself, “where is the fruit?” or “What is the result of their labor”? But Nat and Wanchi were living a steady, normal, fruitbearing life—like Boaz and Ruth. Eventually, of course, the fruit did come, and now through his and the labor of many others, there are golden lampstands in central Europe where there were none. 

A few years after Nat returned from Europe, there was a need for strengthening the campus team in Sacramento. Nat was the obvious choice to serve with the team as one who had a vision of God’s economy; was mature in the Lord, who knew how to coordinate with others and had a shepherding heart for both young people and college students. In spite of his deep commitment to the children’s work, Nat was willing to stretch his capacity and oversee the Sacramento campus team as a player-coach. The campus work in Sacramento has flourished under his labor and care.  

I will always remember Nat’s love for the Lord, the Bible, the ministry, the saints in the church and all the new ones he cared for, both young and old.  As most of you already know, Nat’s heart was very large, and he was always willing to go the extra mile to care for anyone who had a need. I will truly miss my brother’s rich portion of Christ, his service in the Body and his shepherding heart.

3/20/2022,saints,post,Charles Thorpe Barbier,"Sacramento, California","I knew Brother Nat for several months. I got to know a little more about him since I joined the club back in August of last year. We had a bunch in common like we lived in the same local area, he also studied engineering when he was in college like me and some of our other brothers in the Christian club, and above all we were brothers in Christ.

I was very devastated to hear what happened to him and those three girls. This tragic event was something I never saw coming and neither did any of us. Even after three weeks, I’m still hurt by this and I hope I’m able to recover. But I still know that we still have to keep pursuing the Lord no matter what attack the devil might pull out against us.

As 1 Chronicles 16:11 says, Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually.

Nathaniel has finished his race, so we must continue ours because Jesus is the author and finisher of our faith."
3/20/2022,saints,post,Sarah Zhao,,"When I came to Sacramento, I barely knew anyone. My families were all far away. He’s always my emergency contact on paper and in fact. He’s the person I go to when I have questions in the truth, in service, in Christian experience and in human living, when I don’t have the strength to pray, when I cannot break through, when I’m stuck in my mind, when I’m hurt in my soul. His spirit was very strong and exercised, but he never made me feel bad for being weak or making mistakes. When I was single, when my parents were far away, he was my support, my shepherd, and my dad, leading me to my heavenly Father. 

His living taught us to give ourselves to the ministry and to the church. He always encouraged us to memorize the ministry. I can’t forget his bright countenance when we recited verses, footnotes or conference banners to him. And I remember the first time he complimented me was because I sat on the roadside to talk to a young girl. He encouraged me to shepherd people regardless of their situation and background. 

If I saw the vision of a God-man living in the training, I saw the living out of it in bro Nat, from the first time I met him till his last breath. I pray that the Lord would train me and so many to follow his pattern to give ourselves fully and absolutely to the Lord and His purpose"
3/19/2022,family,post,Bethany Kong,"Irvine, CA","My dad was precious in the sight of God. 

In my Bible reading, I was reading through Luke in chapters 11 and 12, everything I read just pointed back to my dad — one who visited people in their homes, rather than preaching to large crowds in big meetings; one who stored up treasures in heaven; one who let the lamp shine on the lampstand to all in the house and as a city on a mountain; and one who was ready for the Lord at an hour that no one expected. I feel like these are just a few aspects of how given my dad was to the Lord, and I suppose that’s why the Lord took him for Himself.

But my dad was also precious in the sight of men. I didn’t realize how many lives my dad touched. All I knew him as was my dad, who would sit around the house, taking every available open stop to set up camp to watch the news, play sudoku, and zoom into his many meetings. But even in his trivial, habitual actions, my dad cared for us in the most genuine way.

My dad drove me everywhere. Despite his busy schedule, running all over the place to take care of people and the church, he also scheduled his life around my school, my violin, and piano lessons. He’d drive 30-45 mins to Davis every week for piano lesson, wait for a good hour or more, and take me home. My dad would occasionally make us pancakes in the morning and tritip for dinner. Whenever I brought up an exam that I was stressed for, he’d tell me to take a break, go get some sun, and call on the Lord. He’d say, “Lord, this exam…” My dad might not have always remembered what grade I was in, but he always checked on my spiritual condition — asking what I was going over in the Irvine Bible studies, and what I had enjoyed at conferences and such. My dad also liked seeing me spend time with the saints, so he’d always invited me to all the Sac State and team outings. Thanks to him, I was able to get to know the saints on the team better and had fun even in the midst of a lonely freshman year of college at home. There’s so many other little things that my dad did for me and my siblings to take care of us in our body, soul, and what seems to me was on his heart the most — our spirit.

To conclude, I would just say that my Dad’s pattern is one that encourages me. I naturally take after my dad personality-wise, so seeing how he loved and served people with no love of his, but with God’s love, I pray that the Lord would duplicate Himself in me likewise.
