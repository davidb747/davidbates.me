## Getting started

```bash
# Get Kubernetes version
kubectl version

# Get cluster information
kubectl cluster-info

# Get information about pods, deployments, services, ...
kubectl get all
kubectl get pods

# Create/modify resource (apply will create if resource doesn't exist)
kubectl create/apply [resource]

# Get bearer token for dashboard
kubectl describe secret -n kube-system

```

## Pods

```bash
# Simple way to create deployment for pod
kubectl run [container-name] --image=[image-name]
kubectl run [podname] --image=nginx:alpine

# Forward port to allow external access
kubectl port-forward [pod] [ports]

# Expose port for deployment/pod
kubectl expose

# Will cause pod to be recreated
kubectl delete pod [name-of-pod]

# Delete Deployment that manages the Pod
kubectl delete deployment [name-of-deployment]

# Create pod
# Dry run: runs command without actually applying it
# Validate yaml is set to true by default
# Will throw error when pod already exists (better to use apply => create / update)
# Save config: when applying in the future: a change map (annotations) is shown, you can overwrite specific settings
kubectl create -f file.pod.yml --dry-run --validate=true --save-config

# Update settings inside a pod
kubectl patch [filename]

# Delete pod based on yml file
kubectl delete -f file.pod.yml

# Get current state of pod (you can see annotations here)
kubectl get pod my-nginx -o yaml

# Get pod info + events
kubectl describe pod my-nginx

# Get into terminal inside container
kubectl exec my-nginx -it sh

# Make modifications to yml of pod that is currently running
kubectl edit -f nginx.pod.yml
```

## Deployments

```bash
# List all deployments and their labels
kubectl get deployment --show-labels

# Get all deployments with specific label
kubectl get deployment -l app=nginx

# Delete deployment
kubectl delete deployment [deployment-name]

# Scale deployment pods
kubectl scale deployment [deployment-name] --replicas=5
kubectl scale deployment -f [deployment-yaml-filename] --replicas=5

# Port forwarding (external port 85 to service port 80)
kubectl port-forward service/node-app 85:80#

# Update a deployment (also pulls new docker image if there is any)
kubectl rollout restart deployment moviestreamer
```

## Services

```bash

# Listen on port 8080 locally and forward to deployment's pod
kubectl port-forward deployment/[deployment-name] 8080

# Listen on port 8080 locally and forward to service's pod
kubectl port-forward service/[service-name] 8080
```
