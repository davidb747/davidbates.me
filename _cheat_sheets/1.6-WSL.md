## Issue with cached memory [^1]

Open up a WSL terminal and check the memory by using the following command.

```bash
free -h
```

If the buff/cache is high (see screenshot above), it can be released by the following command (you need to be in root mode)

```bash
echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
```
