## Build images

```bash
# Build Dockerfile in current folder with tag test:123
docker build -t test:123 .

# Build 
```

## Run and debug image

### Run an image with tty wrapper (so it keeps running => you can access the file system)

```bash
docker run -d -t test:123
```

Command above produces hash, which we can use to run a shell

### Open shell on container (it needs to be running)

```bash
docker exec -it <hash> bash
```
