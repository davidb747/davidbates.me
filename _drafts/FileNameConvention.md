# Purpose
Look at the file names

+ untitled.txt
+ lib.zip
+ 123.doc
+ tmp.txt
+ myidea.txt

Even if we can remember the content of the files temporarily, we will forget soon. 

A good file naming convention is good for organizing and retrieving our files efficiently. 

## How To Name Files?

The most important things to remember about file naming are to be `consistent` and `descriptive` in naming and organizing your files so that it’s obvious where to find a file and what it contains.\[[1]\]

## Step 1 Decide the Information A File Name Should Express

It varies from fields/projects to fields/projects we are working on. 

It is suggested to include the information which indicates the content of the file. If we are cooperating with many others, it is also needed to distinguish our files from others'.

We can think of following information, each is regarded as a component which will be used in Step 2.
+ Name of organization
+ Date or date range
+ Author
+ Name of project or program
+ Type of document, such as "Report", "Proposal" and "Invoice" etc.
+ Spatial data
+ Language of content
+ Version number of file

## Step 2 Decide the Sequence of Each Component

Suppose we have decided to include

+ Date
+ Name of project
+ Type of document
+ Language of content


## Step 3 Make File Name Convention



Follow It


## Common Issues

### Special Characters

### Hypen and Underscore
ID
If Project Name has Hypen or Underscore?

### Spaces

### Acronym

Quotation ("), question marks (?), apostrophes ('), asterisks (*) and spaces can incorrectly terminate the name in some scripts and systems
Semicolons (;) are used to separate commands on many systems, and might produce unexpected results
Some file systems are case sensitive and some are not. So, relying on case to differentiate files is risky


For sequential numbering, use leading zeros to ensure files sort properly.
For example, use “0001, 0002…1001, etc” instead of “1, 2…1001, etc.”
5. Do not use spaces, because they are not recognized by some software.
Instead use underscores (file_name), dashes (file-name), no separation
(filename), or camel case (FileName).
Check out more information about File Naming Best Practices on the
Data Management Services web site at http://bit.ly/file_naming.
Consider including a README.txt file in your directory that explains your
naming convention along with any abbreviations or codes you have used.

A good format for dates is YYYYMMDD (or YYMMDD). This makes sure
all your files stay in chronological order, even over many years.
2. Don’t make file names too long; longer names do not work well with all
types of software.

# Practices & Examples
## IT Project

File is usually managed in version control system, therefore, version is not included in the file name.

LanguageCode\_DateCreated\_ProjectName\_TypeOfDocument\_Authors\[\_ContentSummary\]\.FileExtension

ContentSummary is optional
